## Economic-development-and-life-expectancy
### Do citizens of wealthier countries live longer? Do people live longer in countries with a high GDP per capita? Does economic development raise life expectancy?
To answer this, I:
1.	First, started with descriptive statistics to summarise the characteristics of data and used statistical visualizations to examine important features.
2.	Second, a correlation analysis is performed to understand the nature of any existing relationship.
3.	Third, a linear regression model was applied to predict the dependent variable, Life Expectancy, using measures of GDP per capita.
4.	Finally, reached the conclusion, if the relationship was statistically significant or not.
